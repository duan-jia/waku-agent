# Evals and tracing

The LLM-Ops pillar: two kinds of eval, a third tier that needs Docker, a
release gate that needs the first two, and a trace of every turn.

## Two kinds of eval, never mixed

*"Did it create the right calendar event?"* is a unit test: 0 or 1, and no
model judges it. *"Was the reply helpful?"* is a judged score with a threshold.
Conflating the two is the most common eval mistake, so here they are separate
suites you can diff.

```bash
make eval          # deterministic: "did the right tool fire?" — 0 or 1, no model judges it
make eval-judge    # LLM-as-judge: "was the reply helpful?" — a scored %, needs a key
make gate          # the release gate: deterministic must pass 100%, judge must clear threshold
```

Deterministic tests are plain pytest in
[`evals/deterministic/`](../evals/deterministic); judged ones use DeepEval in
[`evals/judge/`](../evals/judge). CI runs the deterministic tier on every PR.
The judge tier needs an API key, so `make gate` runs it locally.

There is a third directory, [`evals/hosted_docker/`](../evals/hosted_docker):
0/1 and offline like the deterministic tier, but it needs a Docker daemon, so
it runs in its own `hosted-docker` CI job and not in `make gate`. It is only
for `hosted/`, the deployment that runs waku for other people on a server. With
no daemon, it skips the whole directory and says why.

**Where the results show:** the terminal, and the dashboard's **Evals** page,
under Observability in the sidebar: how many deterministic tests and judge
suites exist, what the last `make gate` run passed and failed per suite, the
release-gate verdict, and an eval-history table with one row
per `make gate`. On agent.waku.one the page says that evals run in CI and in
`make gate` before an upgrade, because a tenant container ships no `evals/`.

## Catching bugs

When you catch a bug by using the thing live, you fix it AND add a
deterministic case so it can never come back. A real example from this repo:
the agent didn't know the current *time* and asked for it before scheduling
"in 30 minutes". The fix is in [`session.py`](../waku/runtime/session.py), and
[`test_working_memory.py`](../evals/deterministic/test_working_memory.py) locks
it in. Run `make gate` → green → the eval history records the run.

## Spend is permanent

Every LLM call's tokens are appended to `~/.waku/usage.jsonl`, an append-only
ledger that a demo reset never wipes. The **Spend** tab of the
**Observability** page shows the all-time cost and tokens, broken down per
model and per day. Tokens × list price is the estimate. On agent.waku.one each turn's receipt also records what the platform
charged, and for that turn the charge replaces the estimate. The Spend card and tab lead with one
total, "$X total · $Y charged + $Z estimated", and the model, treg and memory split adds up to it.

## Tracing is always on

Every turn appends readable lines to `~/.waku/traces/<date>.jsonl` with zero
setup. A trace is the record of one turn: its steps in order, each with its
input, output, time and cost. The **Turns** tab of the **Observability** page
lists the turns and opens each one into a waterfall of its steps, and the
**Tools** tab counts every tool call by where it went (treg with each
endpoint and its cost, Waku Memory, local and MCP tools). Each step carries a
span kind: `llm`, `tool`, `retrieval`, `memory_write` or `gate`. The OTel
export below uses the OpenTelemetry GenAI attribute names
(`gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.tool.name`, …),
mapped in one table, `GENAI` in `waku/ops/observability.py`.

For span-waterfall views in Phoenix:

```bash
pip install -e '.[tracing]'
make trace                                            # Phoenix at localhost:6006
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 make run
```

Langfuse cloud speaks the same OTel toggle.
