"""Research reads the company brain first (spec 009 A).

A research turn used to start from nothing: every hosted turn showed "Used 0",
and the second time Sean asked about mem0's competitors the agent repeated the
whole search instead of starting from the first report. The research is in
Waku Memory, which only an MCP search reaches, so the agent's own code runs
that search before the model's first call, every research turn, instead of
hoping the model thinks of it.

When a turn is research (the research-report skill matched the message) and
Waku Memory is connected, this module:

  1. runs memory.search twice: once for the subject, in every scope, and once
     for earlier reports, kind `semantic` (the kind spec 007 saves a report
     as), so an earlier report is found even when facts crowd the first list,
  2. hands back what it found as the turn's Used list, plus each call as a
     tool event, the same shape the loop emits for a model's own
     waku_memory_memory_search, which is what waku.one's panel already reads,
  3. reads each earlier report it found (memory.get, at most REPORT_LIMIT)
     and keeps only its digest: title, Summary and key numbers, at most
     reports.DIGEST_CHARS. A search answers with a snippet of a long body,
     so without this the model fetched every whole report itself, and each
     rode along on every later call of the turn (2026-10-05: 328.5k tokens
     in, twice an earlier turn's),
  4. writes the "What the company brain already knows" block for the system
     prompt, each memory with its date and id, and each report as its digest.

A search that fails is logged and skipped: reading first is a help, and a
turn never waits on it or fails for it. Like consolidation and reports, this
module never sees the transport; app.py passes search_via()'s callable, so a
fake stands in for it in the evals.
