"""Waku Memory: one memory shared by every agent you use.

The Waku agent's own memory is local. Waku Memory is a hosted MCP server at
https://api.waku.one/mcp. Claude Code, Codex, Grok Bot and this agent can all
connect to it, so a fact saved in one can be recalled in another. Waku also
writes each of its facts to <home>/memory/<id>.md, one file per fact, which
is the shape the Waku Memory importer reads.

Spec 006: once the server is connected, remember_via() gives consolidation a
callable that sends each fact it keeps with memory.remember. Spec 007 sends a
turn's research report through the same callable. Those are the only uploads,
and they go to the server the person connected, with their sign-in. Spec 009:
search_via() gives a research turn one read of memory.search before the model
starts, so research begins from what the person's brain already holds.

`waku connect waku-memory` (or `/connect waku-memory` in the dashboard chat)
adds the server to WAKU_HOME/mcp.json next to any servers already there, then
signs you in once in your browser. Its tools then load like any MCP server's,
named `waku_memory_*`.
